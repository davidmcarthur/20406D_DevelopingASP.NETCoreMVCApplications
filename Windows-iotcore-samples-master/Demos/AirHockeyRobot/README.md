# Air Hockey Robot

This project showcases a full-sized air hockey robot controlled by a MinnowBoard Max running Windows 10 IoT Core. The robot uses a color blob tracking camera to detect the location goals and the XY mallet position. All of these devices hook into a Minnowboard Max, which is responsible for taking in puck position data and calculating motor movements in response.
