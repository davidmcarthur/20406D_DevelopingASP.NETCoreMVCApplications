# Serial Number

This sample demonstrates how to get the device serial number as documented here: [Access SMBIOS information from a Universal Windows App](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/desktop/SysInfo/access-smbios-information-from-a-universal-windows-app).

In order for this to work the restricted capability must be declared in the appxmanifest, and the minimum target version for the project must be 17134 or higher.
